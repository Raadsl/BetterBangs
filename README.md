# BetterBangs

This extension adds DuckDuckGo bangs to [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com/).
It has an optional history tracking feature to see which Bangs you use the most. A nice stat.

## Notes
I highly recommend using Startpage, since it has Google results as well + a lot of privacy. But if you still decide to use Google, the extension will only work on Google.com and Google.nl domains. So if it doesn't work, that is the reason.

It works by checking if the query contains an !, if it does it checks the list of bangs and redirects you to the site you want to go to.
The last time the Bang list was updated was on 28-08-2024.
